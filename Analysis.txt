Analysis

Task 0:
 - Time Complexity - O(1)
 - This algorithm is constant time because has a running time independent of the input size

Task 1:
 - Time Complexity - O(n)
 - This algorithm is linear time because it has a for-loop function that iterates from 1 to n

Task 2:
 - Time Complexity - O(n)
 - This algorithm is linear time because it has a for-loop function that iterates from 1 to n

Task 3:
 - Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
 - This algorithm is superlinear time because it has a for-loop function that iterates from 1 to n. However a sorting function which is 0(nlogn),
so the time complexity can be simplified to O(nlog(n))
   
Task 4:
 - Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
 - This algorithm is superlinear time because it has a for-loop function that iterates from 1 to n. However a sorting function which is 0(nlogn),
so the time complexity can be simplified to O(nlog(n))
